As an open-source project without the backing of a big company, community donations are critical to keeping this project going.

Dave wrote [more about this in this week’s iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/566#start) if you want the whole story, but the short version is that this project needs your help.

Every contribution helps, whether it’s a one-time or monthly donation. Every sponsorship directly supports the time [Dave](https://twitter.com/daveverwer) and [Sven](https://twitter.com/_sa_s) dedicate to this project.

We’re in this for the long term to build the package index that the Swift package ecosystem needs, but we need your help. Please consider joining the 99 other people who [sponsor this project through GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/SwiftPackageIndex).

Thank you so much!
