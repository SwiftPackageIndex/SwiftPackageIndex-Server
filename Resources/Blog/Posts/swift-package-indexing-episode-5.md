Unfortunately, there was a mishap with the recording of this episode (and by that, I mean we didn't record it ðŸ˜…), but if you want to join us next time, weâ€™ve already [scheduled the next episode](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1PlKQaNYkAVKE) for two weeks time. Set a reminder and join us!

We'll double-check the recording settings next time, too! ðŸ™ˆ
