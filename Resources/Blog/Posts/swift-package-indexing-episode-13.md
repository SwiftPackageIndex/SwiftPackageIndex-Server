title: Swift Package Indexing - Episode 13
description: All the updates, news, recommendations, and chat from the last couple of weeks in the Swift Package Index.
---

In this week’s news, we talked about the extension of our new "universal documentation" links now supporting linking to specific articles or symbols, the [new documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SPIManifest/documentation) of the `.spi.yml` manifest file, and how [Swift Argument Parser](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) makes creating command line tools a breeze.

We also mentioned [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) and its [Swift Package Index extension](https://www.raycast.com/maximkrouk/swift-package-index) by [Maxim Krouk](https://twitter.com/maximkrouk). Search got even better this week, too, as we [deployed some improvements](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues/2072).

Our quiz segment made a return to cover Swift 5.7 statistics, like how many 5.7-only packages there are and what 5.7 compatibility looks like across the ecosystem.

Our package recommendations this week were:

- [DynamicIslandUtilities](https://swiftpackageindex.com/theblixguy/DynamicIslandUtilities) by [Suyash Srijan](https://swiftpackageindex.com/theblixguy)
- [The Composable Architecture](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) by [Pointfree](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco). We also mentioned [this blog post](https://www.pointfree.co/blog/posts/81-announcing-the-reducer-protocol).
- [RubyGateway](https://swiftpackageindex.com/johnfairh/RubyGateway) by [John Fairhurst](https://swiftpackageindex.com/johnfairh)
- [StatKit](https://swiftpackageindex.com/JimmyMAndersson/StatKit) by [Jimmy M Andersson](https://swiftpackageindex.com/JimmyMAndersson)
