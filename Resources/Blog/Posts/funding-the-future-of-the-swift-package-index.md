title: Funding the Future of the Swift Package Index
description: Many open-source projects are just code and don‚Äôt need constant attention. The Swift Package Index is a little different, so we are opening up GitHub sponors for the project. We'd love your support.

It‚Äôs been almost four months since we [launched the Swift Package Index](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/460#start), and we‚Äôve been so happy to see so many positive reactions to it across the community. Thank you all for checking it out and spreading the word.

It‚Äôs still early days for Swift Package Manager adoption but we are confident that it will become the dominant technology for Swift dependency management, and we want the Swift Package Index to grow right alongside it.

We believe we‚Äôre off to a great start with what we have so far, but this is only the beginning. We have so many ideas for ‚Äú[bug fixes and improvements](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues)‚Äù! üòÇ

Many open-source projects are just code and don‚Äôt need constant maintenance and monitoring, but the Swift Package Index is a little different. It‚Äôs a hosted instance of the site with a [reasonably complex automated build system](/posts/launching-language-and-platform-package-compatibility/) that has run over 600,000 builds so far (increasing by 7,000 more every day!). It takes significant time and effort to keep things running smoothly.

We want to find a way to make sure that we can continue to give this site the time and attention it needs, but we don‚Äôt really want to go down the route of including advertising. Instead, we are opening up [sponsorship on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/SwiftPackageIndex).

If you (or your company) would like to support the site, we would be thrilled to be able to make this a community-funded effort for years to come.

Also, a huge thanks to [Oliver](https://twitter.com/cocoanetics), who beat us to even announcing this by sponsoring the project yesterday! Thanks for being our very first sponsor. üòç

Thank you!
