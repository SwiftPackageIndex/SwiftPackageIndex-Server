title: Swift Package Indexing - Episode 4
description: Here are the show notes for Episode 4 of our little bi-weekly Twitter space discussing everything Swift Package Manager and Swift Package Index. Give it a listen!

We’re two months into our little experiment of bi-weekly Twitter spaces discussing everything Swift Package Manager and [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com), and we’re really enjoying the format. Do you have any feedback on how we’re doing with it? We’d love to hear from you with feedback, suggestions for topics, guest recommendations, or just packages you love that we should feature!

This week’s episode was all about some of the new technologies at WWDC, Swift 5.7, and some package recommendations. Here are the links to what we talked about:
