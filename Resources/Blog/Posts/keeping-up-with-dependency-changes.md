How often do you update your package dependencies, and when you do, do you check whatâ€™s new or changed, or do you just run your tests to check nothing broke and move on? ðŸ˜…

Donâ€™t be embarrassed. Youâ€™re not alone! Even if the package authors have lovingly crafted a detailed change log, checking them for every package you use is painful. Itâ€™s no wonder no one takes the time to do it.

So we built a little tool to make the task easier. Install the [swift-release-notes](https://swiftpackageindex.com/SwiftPackageIndex/ReleaseNotes) tool, and get a list of links to the release notes for all the packages that have pending updates.

```shell
$ swift release-notes ~/Projects/SPI/spi-server

(... progress output removed)

Release notes URLs (updating from):
https://github.com/vapor/fluent-kit/releases (1.19.0)
https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild/releases (main)
https://github.com/vapor/vapor/releases (4.54.0)
https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/releases (main)
https://github.com/vapor/async-kit/releases (1.11.0)
https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-ssl/releases (2.17.1)
https://github.com/apple/swift-tools-support-core/releases (main)
https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-transport-services/releases (1.11.3)
https://github.com/apple/swift-driver/releases (main)
https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/releases (2.36.0)
```

Give it a try and be better aware of what new changes are happening in the packages youâ€™re using!
