It‚Äôs been about seven months since we [launched the Swift Package Index](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/460#start) and we‚Äôve been hard at work implementing a few major updates. Most significantly, [real-world package compatibility](https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/launching-language-and-platform-package-compatibility), [a comprehensive set of RSS feeds and Twitter updates](https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/keeping-up-to-date-with-swift-packages), and most recently [inline README files](https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/inline-readme-files).

But we‚Äôre far from done! üòÖ

So, in the spirit of letting you all know what we‚Äôre planning for this project next, we wanted to start a regular series of blog posts about the direction we‚Äôre heading with feature development. We‚Äôll post every couple of months, giving a quick recap of what we‚Äôve achieved along with where we‚Äôre heading next. It‚Äôs not a formal roadmap. It‚Äôs more a declaration of where our focus will be for the next couple of months.

So without further ado, what are we focusing on next?

## Intermediate Search Page

Currently, search results are displayed inline on the home page, which makes it hard to share package searches (there‚Äôs no URL for a search), or integrate with productivity tools like Alfred or Raycast, or even DuckDuckGo through their [bangs feature](https://duckduckgo.com/bang). We want to fix that.

## Package Collections

If you‚Äôve been following the [package collection work](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0291-package-collections.md) in the SPM project, then it might have struck you that the Swift Package Index would be a great source of package collections, when they are added. We agree! We‚Äôve already been working hard to prepare for this feature and want to have something publicly available as soon as the feature becomes available in SPM.

## Design updates

The site design suited our feature set at launch but has become a little overloaded as we added features. This work has already started, with a new package page layout rolling out last Friday. There‚Äôs more to do though, including improvements to the home page. The lists of recent package additions and recent package releases are fine, but we can do better!

## The Swift Package Index macOS App

We‚Äôve always wanted to create a Swift Package Index Mac app of some kind. The app‚Äôs main purpose would be to allow you to easily try packages out in a Swift Playground (utilising the wonderful [Arena](https://swiftpackageindex.com/finestructure/Arena) tool). But it might end up being more over the long term. We want to define what this app will do, and then get something out that works towards that definition. We talked about the interesting story behind the ‚ÄúTry this package‚Äù feature [on John Sundell‚Äôs podcast last year](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/75/) if you‚Äôre interested!

## And More‚Ä¶

This is not a comprehensive list of things we‚Äôll do. This is a young project, and we want to keep development agile. If we have a great idea, it may go into the plan ahead of everything you read above!
