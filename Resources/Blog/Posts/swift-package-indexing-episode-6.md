No guest this week, so the show was back to Dave and Sven talking about all things Swift packages! We discussed some of the open-source contributions we’ve received over the last few weeks and some more upcoming work on hosted DocC documentation.

Sven also surprised Dave with a Swift Package Index trivia quiz! Do you know what percentage of packages have zero open issues or who has the most packages in the index? There’s only one way to find out!

Of course, we also had some package recommendations and details about some significant releases from the last two weeks:

- [Sparkle](https://swiftpackageindex.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle) by [Sparkle Project](https://swiftpackageindex.com/sparkle-project)
- [Lottie](https://swiftpackageindex.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) by [Airbnb](https://swiftpackageindex.com/airbnb)
- [URLCompatibilityKit](https://swiftpackageindex.com/MarcoEidinger/URLCompatibilityKit) by [Marco Eidinger](https://swiftpackageindex.com/MarcoEidinger)
- [CustomRepeatDate](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pixyzehn/custom-repeat-date) by [Hiroki Nagasawa](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pixyzehn)
