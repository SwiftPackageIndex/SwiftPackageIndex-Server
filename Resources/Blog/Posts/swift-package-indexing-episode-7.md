We just wrapped up another episode of Swift Package Indexing! We talked again about the progress weâ€™ve made working towards versioned documentation hosting. Sven had more quiz questions for Dave, and of course, we talked about community packages!

The packages from this week wereâ€¦

- [AirbnbSwift](https://swiftpackageindex.com/airbnb/swift) from [Airbnb](https://swiftpackageindex.com/airbnb)
- [Drops](https://swiftpackageindex.com/omaralbeik/Drops) from [Omar Albeik](https://swiftpackageindex.com/omaralbeik)
- [SwiftDraw](https://swiftpackageindex.com/swhitty/SwiftDraw) by [Simon Whitty](https://swiftpackageindex.com/swhitty)

- [swift-confidential-plugin](https://swiftpackageindex.com/securevale/swift-confidential-plugin) from [Secure Vale](https://swiftpackageindex.com/securevale)

The Twitter Spaces UI continues to baffle Dave, and yet again he messed up the recording. ðŸ™„ Thereâ€™s very little he can be trusted with these days. Apologies for that! Itâ€™s definitely set for next time, though. (Iâ€™m absolutely _certain_ I set it for this time, too ðŸ˜¬).

[Set yourself a reminder, and join us live](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1gqxvlyakkWGB) on the 4th August!
