title: Support for Swift 5.10

The march of Swift's progress continues, and beta versions of Swift 5.10 have been available for a few weeks now, both in pre-releases of Xcode 15.3 and as [nightly snapshots from Swift.org](https://www.swift.org/download/#swift-510-development).

What does a new release of Swift mean? It means the Swift Package Index needs to chew through tens of thousands of new compatibility tests, and we're delighted to announce that all processing is complete and compatibility results for Swift 5.10 are available on every package page! ðŸŽ‰

The [next Swift version update will be for for Swift 6](https://forums.swift.org/t/70220), and we're planning something special for that! Major version numbers deserve major attention!
