title: Swift Package Indexing - Episode 12
description: This week’s show had more hosted documentation talk, 5.7 build processing news, package registry talk, and of course the usual mix of community packages!
---

We started this episode, as usual, with some news from the project. We talked about generic documentation links (so you can share a link to your package’s documentation without encoding a branch or tag version in the URL), the completion of our Swift 5.7 build processing and the new DocC sidebar. Then we chatted about the Thread Sanitizer (TSAN) and Swift on the Server projects and more virtualization talk!

We also spoke about the [Package Registry Service](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0292-package-registry-service.md) proposal and its [reference implementation](https://github.com/mattt/swift-registry), how a registry differs from an index, what package identifiers will bring, and more.

Our community packages for this week were:

- [Kitura](https://swiftpackageindex.com/Kitura/Kitura) 3.0 by the [Kitura Team](https://swiftpackageindex.com/Kitura)
