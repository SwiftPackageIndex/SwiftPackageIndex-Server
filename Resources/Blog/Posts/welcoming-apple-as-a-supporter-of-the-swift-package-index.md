As we approach our third anniversary working on the Swift Package Index, it’s great to see the project grow. We’ve continued adding features and working with the community to showcase the incredible work that open-source package authors contribute to the Swift ecosystem.

It has been a long time since we were able to think of this as a “side project“, and as the site becomes a more significant part of this community, the maintenance commitment that the project requires also grows.

Until now, we have run the project with the generous support of our [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/SwiftPackageIndex) and the support of commercial partners, Stream, Emerge Tools, MacStadium, and Microsoft Azure, covering the site infrastructure and a portion of our time keeping the site operational and moving forward. However, this support only covers a fraction of the time we spend working on the project.

Today, we’re thrilled to welcome another sponsor: Apple. They have generously added their public and financial support to the project, and we couldn’t be happier.

Apple’s support and the community support we already enjoy via your GitHub sponsorships have set us on a path where the Swift Package Index can be a project that fully supports our work financially. It’s also wonderful to have Apple’s support of this community-built, open source project.

We can’t wait to work with Apple and the rest of the Swift community to build the very best place to find Swift packages.

You can see all of our supporters on the [Supporters page](https://swiftpackageindex.com/supporters) and there is an announcement post on the [Swift.org blog](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-package-index-developer-spotlight/), too.
