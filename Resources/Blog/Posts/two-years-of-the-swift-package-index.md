It‚Äôs been exactly two years since the [first commit](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/commit/f4475174b83aeb5d35b567c0b6042efe8351a0d1)¬π of the Swift Package Index! More than 950 pull requests and 5,250 commits later, we now index and compatibility test over 4,500 packages!

The site‚Äôs goal has always been to **help you make good decisions about the dependencies you include in your projects**, and that goal remains today. Including third party code in your app is a delicate balance between future maintenance of that dependency and the time it can save you today. To make those decisions, you need lots of metadata, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to provide.

A milestone like this is also an excellent time to mention that this project is open-source and open to contributions! We‚Äôve had [many valuable contributions](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/graphs/contributors) in the past couple of years, but there‚Äôs [plenty more to do](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues). We‚Äôve marked some issues with the ‚Äú[good first issue](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)‚Äù tag if you‚Äôre looking for a place to start. We‚Äôd also love to welcome you [over on our Discord](https://discord.gg/vQRb6KkYRw) if you want to contribute.

So, I hope you‚Äôll join me in wishing the Swift Package Index a happy birthday! Helping to create something for the community has been a great experience so far, and we‚Äôre excited about where we can take this project in the future! ü•Ç

¬π In March 2020, we experimented with a Vapor 3 version of the project, and there was the [SwiftPM Library](https://daveverwer.com/blog/launching-the-swiftpm-library/) before that. The first commit of the software that became what you use today was made on the 25th of April 2020, though.
