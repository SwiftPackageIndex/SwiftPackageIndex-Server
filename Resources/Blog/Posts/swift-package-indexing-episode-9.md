We just wrapped up Episode 9 of Swift Package Indexing, which was another chat about what’s going on in the world of Swift packages!

As usual, we started with some updates about the Package Index itself. Bugs and improvements to DocC documentation, a relaxation of the rules for what types of packages belong in the index, improvements to search by Joe Heck (and the fascinating discussion in [#1876](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/discussions/1876)), and some upcoming changes from Javier Cuesta around acknowledging package maintainers and authors!

We then had our usual Quiz and Package recommendations:

### Quiz

Here are this episodes questions, asked via Twitter:
