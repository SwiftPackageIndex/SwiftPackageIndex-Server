We just wrapped up our latest Twitter Space. This is becoming a habit!

We started with our usual discussion of what we’ve been up to with the Package Index, focusing primarily on the compatibility build system, and the Swift 5.7 build backlog. We also discussed external documentation hosting for package authors, and our internal package scoring system.

If you are curious about the performance of virtual machines created with the [Virtualization framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization) you’ll hear us mentioning some surprising results, discovered while using [VirtualBuddy](https://github.com/insidegui/VirtualBuddy) by [Guilherme Rambo](https://twitter.com/_inside).

Then, our package recommendations:

- [PackageBuildInfo](https://swiftpackageindex.com/DimaRU/PackageBuildInfo) by [Dmitriy Borovikov](https://swiftpackageindex.com/DimaRU)
- [DeckUI](https://swiftpackageindex.com/joshdholtz/DeckUI) by [Josh Holtz](https://swiftpackageindex.com/joshdholtz)
- [swift-math-parser](https://swiftpackageindex.com/bradhowes/swift-math-parser) by [Brad Howes](https://swiftpackageindex.com/bradhowes)
- [MarkCodable](https://swiftpackageindex.com/MarkCodable/MarkCodable) by [Marin Todorov](https://swiftpackageindex.com/icanzilb)

You can [listen to the Space recording](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1jMKgLgyQWgGL) if you missed it live, or [join us for our next scheduled space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnxnpRQmLkGO). We hope to see you there!
