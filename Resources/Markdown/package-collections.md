## Package Collections

[Added in Swift 5.5](https://swift.org/blog/package-collections/), package collections are a way to group and search Swift packages.

The Swift Package Index dynamically generates package collections containing all packages from every package author in the index. Each author page includes a "Copy Package Collection URL" button that copies a link you can directly paste into Xcode. For example, from the [Vapor project's author page on the Swift Package Index](/vapor):

<picture class="shadow">
  <source srcset="/images/screenshots/author-page-vapor-packages~dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/author-page-vapor-packages~light.png" alt="Package Collection support on the Swift Package Index.">
</picture>

### Using Package Collections with Xcode

Select your project in the Xcode project navigator, select it again in the projects and targets list, and switch to the Swift Packages tab:

<picture>
  <source srcset="/images/screenshots/xcode-13-swift-packages-tab~dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/xcode-13-swift-packages-tab~light.png" alt="Xcode 13 showing the Swift Packages tab.">
</picture>

Click the `+` button below the Packages list, and you'll see a Collections list on the left and details about the packages in each collection on the right.

  <img src="/images/screenshots/xcode-13-package-collections~light.png" alt="Xcode 13 showing the package collection manager.">
</picture>

Click the `+` at the bottom of the Collections list and paste in the URL to a package collection. That's it! You can now add packages from that collection to your project by selecting one and clicking "Add Package".

### Using Package Collections with the Swift Package Manager

To add a package collection using the `swift` command-line tool, use the `swift package-collection add` command:

```
swift package-collection add https://swiftpackageindex.com/vapor/collection.json
```

> **Note:** If you see an error `unable to invoke subcommand` when running `swift package-collection`, ensure you have at least Swift 5.5 installed. You can check which version of Swift you're running with `swift --version`.

Then, to describe a package, use the `swift package-collection describe` command:

```
swift package-collection describe https://github.com/vapor/vapor
```

The default output is plain text, but the command can output JSON if you add the `--json` parameter to the `describe` subcommand.

Finally, to remove a package collection, call `swift package-collection remove`:

```
swift package-collection remove https://swiftpackageindex.com/vapor/collection.json
```
