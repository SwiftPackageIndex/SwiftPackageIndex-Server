There are many ways to contribute to the Swift Package Index. Whether it's helping to promote the site, suggesting or discussing a new feature, reporting a bug if you find one, through to helping with bug fixing, or the design/development of the software, we'd love to have you as a contributor.

To keep our issues list under control, most bug reports or feature requests work best started as a [discussion in our forum](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/discussions). From there, we can promote it into an issue and start work on a pull request. We have plenty of [open issues](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues) if you'd like to get started. We've also tagged some with a [good first issue](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label.

We also have a Discord server. If you'd like to join, please [use this invite](https://discord.gg/vQRb6KkYRw)!
