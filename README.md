![The Swift Package Index](.readme-images/swift-package-index.png)

## Introduction

**The Swift Package Index helps you make better decisions about the dependencies you use in your apps**.

The [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com) is the place to find packages that are compatible with the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). The project is [open-source](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/blob/main/LICENSE) and written in Swift using [Vapor](https://swiftpackageindex.com/vapor/vapor). Vapor is an HTTP web framework for Swift. It is written in Vapor because it provides an expressive and easy-to-use foundation for websites, APIs, or cloud projects.
